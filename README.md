Feed Hungry Hungry Hippos (H3) - Do Languange Modeling with a ðŸ¦› (unofficial)
## Get Started
This repository contains scripts for training and testing [H3](https://github.com/HazyResearch/H3) State Space Models.

Varios experiments can be found as [notebooks](./examples/notebooks).

## Acknowledgments
This work is based of the research [Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052) paper. The implementation of the H3 model sourced from the [official repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/H3).

    abstract = "The scale, variety, and quantity of publicly-available NLP datasets has grown rapidly as researchers propose new tasks, larger models, and novel benchmarks. Datasets is a community library for contemporary NLP designed to support this ecosystem. Datasets aims to standardize end-user interfaces, versioning, and documentation, while providing a lightweight front-end that behaves similarly for small datasets as for internet-scale corpora. The design of the library incorporates a distributed, community-driven approach to adding datasets and documenting usage. After a year of development, the library now includes more than 650 unique datasets, has more than 250 contributors, and has helped support a variety of novel cross-dataset research projects and shared tasks. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.",
